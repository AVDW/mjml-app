##### Launch environment
Open a terminal, clone this repository, go into the generated folder, and run
``` bash

npm install && npm run dev

```
Wait for a few second, focus on the newly created window and hit Cmd+R to refresh the app.
It will start a new development server that will allow you to live reload the app when you change the code.

Open your Favorite text editor (we use Vim because it is simply better), and start playing around with the code

##### Code quality

Once you have your feature ready, run the static code analysis:

``` bash

npm run lint

```
Yes, commas-dangle on, sorry haters!
